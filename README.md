# Adopt Don't Shop!
 
## Description

The Adopt, Don't Shop is a fullstack web application that allows users to search for adoptable dogs in a MySQL database.  Users must first sign up, then can log in to browse the dogs.  If the current dogs do not fit the adoptees wants, the user can submit a form to be contacted at a later date when a dog comes in that is is a good fit for their home. Bow-wow!
